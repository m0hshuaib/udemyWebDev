<h1>Easy White Bread Recipe</h1>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>500g (1lb 1oz) strong white bread flour, plus a little extra flour for finishing</li>
<li>40g (1½oz) soft butter</li>
<li>7g sachet fast-action dried yeast</li>
<li>1½ tsp salt</li>
<li>About 300ml (10¾fl oz) tepid water (warm, not cold – about body temperature)</li>
<li>A little olive or sunflower oil</li>
</ul>



<h2>Method</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Put the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the butter. Add the yeast at one side of the bowl and add the salt at the other (to prevent the salt from killing the yeast).
</li>
    <li>Stir all the ingredients with a spoon to combine.
</li>
    <li>Add half of the water and turn the mixture round with your fingers. Continue adding water a little at a time until you’ve picked up all the flour from the sides of the bowl. You want a dough that is well combined and soft but not sticky or soggy.
</li>
    <li>Mix with your fingers to ensure all ingredients are combined and use the mixture to clean the inside of the bowl.
</li>
    <li>Keep going until the mixture forms a rough dough.
</li>
    <li>Lightly grease a clean work surface with a teaspoon of oil (using oil instead of flour keeps the dough consistent).
</li>
    <li>Turn out the dough onto the greased surface and fold the far edge of the dough into the middle, then turn the dough by 45 degrees and repeat. Do this several times until the dough is lightly coated all over in olive oil.
</li>
    <li>Knead the dough by pushing it out in one direction with the heel of your hand, then fold it back on itself. Turn the dough by 90 degrees and repeat. Kneading stretches the gluten and makes the dough elastic. Do this for about 4 or 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and stretchy.
</li>
    <li>Clean and lightly oil your mixing bowl, and put the dough back into it. Cover with a damp tea towel or lightly oiled cling film and set it aside to prove. The dough should double in size, which usually takes around one hour (but will vary depending on room temperature).
</li>
    <li>Line a baking tray with baking or silicone paper.
</li>
    <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, scrape it out of the bowl to shape it. The texture should be bouncy and shiny.
</li>
    <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knock it back by kneading it firmly to ‘knock’ out the air.
</li>
    <li>Shape the dough into a loaf shape and place it on the prepared baking tray.
</li>
    <li>Cover with a damp tea towel and let it prove again for about 30 minutes.
</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 220°C (200°C fan)/425°F/gas mark 7.
</li>
    <li>Bake the loaf for 30–35 minutes until golden brown and crusty.
</li>
    <li>Cool on a wire rack before slicing and enjoying!</li>
</ol>
